# Linear_Regression_Online_Taxis_Price_Prediction
This project aimed to develop a machine learning-based solution for predicting online taxi prices specifically for popular ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft. The focus was on utilizing the Linear Regression model, a commonly used algorithm for predicting continuous variables, to achieve accurate price predictions. By leveraging historical data and relevant features, such as distance, time of day, traffic conditions, and other factors that influence taxi prices, the Linear Regression model was trained to learn the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, resulting resulting in an R2 score of 93% and minimal errors below 5%.

Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-Learn
